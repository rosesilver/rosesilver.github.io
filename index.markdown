# About Me

I did my PhD in math at the University of Manchester in the north of England, followed by a research postdoc at the University of Leeds and a three year stint as a Visiting Assistant Professor at UC Santa Barbara. After this I was lucky enough to land a place in Google's AI Residency, which in theory was hosted in Mountain View although thanks to COVID the entire 18 month residency was remote.

Since then I've taken a couple of months out to rest and figure out what I want to do next, and I'm now looking for AI research / machine learning / data science jobs in the Bay Area with a focus on either AI fairness or social good. This includes things like:

- Long-term AI fairness work: Figuring out how to train fairer models and developing strategies and tools to enable other ML practitioners to do the same.
- Short-term AI fairness work: Identifying and mitigating biases in current models, implementing harm reduction measures to protect people from marginalized groups while we work on the longer-term issues.
- AI for social good: Projects that aren't specifically about the models or algorithms themselves but use machine learning to contribute to making the world a better place. Things like: using ML to generate better real-time captioning for deaf people, crunch data for new drug development, etc.

- Here is my [resume](/files/resume2020.pdf) and my [academic CV](/files/CV2019.pdf).
- You can find out more about my math research on the [Math Research](/math-research/) page.
- Here is my [Github](https://github.com/zeefryer), although it's a bit bare since most of what I worked on at Google isn't public. You can find a few samples of code I wrote at Google [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/commit/eb2b142f26e39aac1dcbb768417465ae9d4e5af6) and [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/graph_compression/contrastive_learning/learning_latents).

# Contact

- Best way to contact me is by email: [fryer.zee@gmail.com](fryer.zee@gmail.com).
- I'm based in Oakland, California. I'm open to remote work but I plan to stay physically in the Bay Area for the foreseeable future.
