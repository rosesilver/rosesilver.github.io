# Rose Silver

I am a PhD student in computer science at Northeastern University. I'm interested in algorithms, privacy, and the interplay between theory and practice. My advisor is Jonathan Ullman. I'm a member of the Northeastern Theory Group and the Cryptography and Privacy Group. You can reach me at silver.r@northeastern.edu. 

Besides computer science, my current hobbies include: singing with the Marsh Chapel Choir, learning Spanish, and discovering the best cafes in Boston.
