##  Zee Fryer (they/them)

I did my PhD in math at the University of Manchester in the north of England, followed by a research postdoc at the University of Leeds and a three year stint as a Visiting Assistant Professor at UC Santa Barbara. 

After this I was lucky enough to land a place in Google's AI Residency, which in theory was hosted in Mountain View but in practice (thanks COVID) the entire 18 month residency was remote. I spent half my time working with the Discrete Algorithms team and half working with Responsible AI.

Since then I've taken a couple of months out to rest and figure out what I want to do next, and I'm now looking for AI research / machine learning / data science jobs in the Bay Area with a focus on either **AI fairness or social good**. This includes things like:

- Long-term AI fairness work: Figuring out how to train fairer models and developing strategies and tools to enable other ML practitioners to do the same.
- Short-term AI fairness work: Identifying and mitigating biases in current models, implementing harm reduction measures to protect people from marginalized groups while we work on the longer-term issues, toxicity/hate speech detection.
  - I'm particularly interested in building on the work I did at Google on counterfactual fairness and toxicity detection in text-based models, and how this interacts with large language models such as LaMDA.
- AI for social good: Projects that aren't specifically about the models or algorithms themselves but use machine learning to contribute to making the world a better place. Things like: using ML to generate better real-time captioning for deaf people, crunch data for new drug development, etc.
